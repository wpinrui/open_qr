# -c: Critique Mode

## Steps
1. Ask user what to critique (specific file, feature, or entire codebase)
2. Read the relevant code thoroughly
3. Analyze for:
   - **Architecture** - Is the structure sound? Any coupling issues?
   - **Code quality** - Readability, naming, complexity
   - **Performance** - Bottlenecks, unnecessary work
   - **Security** - Input validation, data handling
   - **Missing pieces** - Error handling, edge cases, tests
4. Present findings honestly, grouped by category
5. Suggest concrete improvements with priority ranking
