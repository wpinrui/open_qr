# -m: Metacognition / Self-Improvement

## Steps
1. Read all files in `agents/memory/` and `agents/rules/`
2. Reflect on recent interactions:
   - What went well?
   - What mistakes were repeated?
   - What rules are unclear or missing?
   - What workflow friction exists?
3. Propose updates to agent files:
   - New entries in `mistakes.md` or `preferences.md`
   - Rule clarifications in `rules/`
   - New commands or command improvements
4. Present proposals to user for approval before making changes
5. Update `agents/meta/file-health.md` if any files are getting large
